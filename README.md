TimEx: An Integrated Approach for Optimizing Time Series Visual Exploration
There are 6 files; 4 files for calculating the efficiency in terms of number of operations and 2 files for assessing the effectiveness in terms of quality of recommended visualizations.
4 files for calculating the efficiency in terms of number of operations:
     TimEx_Subsequence Length(R)--->changing the subsequence length with fixed shift length and k value,
     TimEx_Shift Length(R)--->changing the shift length with fixed subsequence length and k value,
     TimEx_K--->changing k values with fixed subsequence and shift lengths.
     TimEx_Splitting--->splitting the data into 3 segments for monitoring the behavior with different characteristics of data.
2 files for assessing the effectiveness in terms of quality of recommended visualizations:
     Effectiveness_Subsequence Length(S)_K-->changing the shift length and k value with fixed subsequence length,
     Effectiveness_Subsequence Length(R)_K-->changing the subsequence length and k value with fixed shift length.
